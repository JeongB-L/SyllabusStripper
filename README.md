## Inspiration

Syllabus Stripper is inspired by that annoying ritual we all do at the beginning of the semester of setting up our calendar. We hate it, so do you. No one wants to spend hours going through syllabus after syllabus creating event after event while we could be doing much more important things. Syllabus Stripper is here to expedite that process. 

## What it does
In order to simplify the process, Syllabus Stripper allows students to give us their syllabi and let us handle the dirty work.

With the simple user interface, students can easily upload their syllabus in either docx, doc, or pdf formats and download an iCalendar file they can import into their virtual calendars containing important information from the class.

## How we built it
To create Syllabus Stripper, we used a combination of [Arjun's job to fill this in] to implement the frontend side of the web-app. With the backend side, we utilized [Fill this in later after we have everything done]. 

Additionally we used GitHub for source control and some intense L33T whiteboard drawing to collaboratively discuss our ideas.

We also used widely available Python libraries such as [Insert stuff here] to make the code readable and more efficient.

## Challenges we ran into

[Do this later retrospectively]

- It's not inherently obvious how to take data from PDFs, docx, and doc and extract events out of it
- etc...

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What's next for Syllabus Stripper

[Talk about future plans and how we can improve upon this project further]

- Apply more effective models to get a lower error on extracting events
- Support more file types?
- Idk add more later lul
