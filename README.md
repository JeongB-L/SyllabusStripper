# SyllabusStripper
For HelloWorld 2020, our group decided we wanted to work on a full-stack website that utilizes machine learning in order to scrape an uploaded syllabus and return a .ics file containing all the important due-dates for a college student. We're really excited to participate and give you guys an amazing product!
